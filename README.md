Our github page for COSC345 2022. Our project is called Manu and is going to be a game about matching bird pictures or sounds with their names.

Our team consists of Daniel Robinson(@Daniel-Ian-Robinson), Will Rushton(@wrushton0), Madeline McCane(@mgmccane), and Jackson North(@NyoomNyoom).

For the most up to date version of our quiz game, please clone the "main"
branch as the "development" branch is the branch that we will be working out of.
